Wisconsin Breast Cancer
Task: Predicting Time To Recur (last variable)

Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by Dr. Wolberg since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. 

The first 30 features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. 

Attribute information

1) Lymph node status - number of positive axillary lymph nodes observed at time of surgery
2-32) Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry 
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
The mean, standard error, and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 4 is Mean Radius, field 14 is Radius SE, field 24 is Worst Radius.
Values for features 4-33 are recoded with four significant digits.
32) Tumor size - diameter of the excised tumor in centimeters
33) Time (recurrence or disease-free time)
